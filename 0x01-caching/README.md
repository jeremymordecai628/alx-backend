### What a caching system is

A caching system is a high-speed data storage layer that stores a subset of data, typically transient in nature, so that future requests for that data are served up faster than by accessing the data’s primary storage location. It is an integral part of computing systems, enhancing performance and efficiency by keeping frequently accessed or recently accessed data closer to the processing unit.

### What FIFO means

FIFO stands for First In, First Out. It is a cache eviction policy where the first item added to the cache is the first one to be removed when the cache reaches its limit. This method ensures that the oldest data in the cache is the first to be evicted.

### What LIFO means

LIFO stands for Last In, First Out. It is a cache eviction policy where the most recently added item is the first one to be removed when the cache reaches its limit. This method prioritizes keeping older data longer in the cache.

### What LRU means

LRU stands for Least Recently Used. It is a cache eviction policy that removes the least recently accessed item first when the cache reaches its limit. This method ensures that data which hasn’t been accessed for a while is evicted before more frequently accessed data.

### What MRU means

MRU stands for Most Recently Used. It is a cache eviction policy where the most recently accessed item is removed first when the cache reaches its limit. This method can be useful in scenarios where recently used data is unlikely to be reused soon.

### What LFU means

LFU stands for Least Frequently Used. It is a cache eviction policy that removes the least frequently accessed items first when the cache reaches its limit. This method ensures that items which are accessed infrequently are evicted before more frequently accessed items.

### What the purpose of a caching system

The primary purpose of a caching system is to improve the performance and efficiency of data retrieval. By storing frequently accessed or recently accessed data in a faster storage medium (such as RAM), caching reduces the time and resources needed to fetch data from slower storage systems, like databases or disk drives.

### What limits a caching system have

Caching systems have several limits:
- **Storage Capacity**: Limited by the size of the cache memory.
- **Eviction Policy**: Decisions on which data to remove when the cache is full can impact performance.
- **Staleness**: Cached data can become outdated if the underlying data changes frequently.
- **Complexity**: Managing and implementing a caching system adds complexity to the system architecture.
- **Consistency**: Ensuring the cached data is consistent with the primary data source can be challenging.

Caches are like turbo boosts for your data retrieval, but knowing their constraints helps in designing an efficient system. Want to dive deeper into any of these points?
